Bulgarian Phonetic Layout for Android
=====================================

This Android package adds the Traditional Bulgarian Phonetic layout to be used with external keyboards. The layout corresponds to the Bulgarian Phonetic Layout used in popular Linux Distributions.

Tested with Android 4.4 and a Bluetooth keyboard.

How to use
==========

* Compile the package yourself by setting up Android SDK and running `ant`.
* Get the compiled apk from F-Droid or Google Play (coming soon).

After installing the package, click on your hardware keyboard in Android's input settings and choose the Bulgarian Phonetic layout.

Thanks to juodumas (https://github.com/juodumas) for his Lithuanian layouts package, from which I borrowed the project structure and other things.
